[BipedalWalker](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/)

Description - Get a 2D biped walker to walk through rough terrain.
Solved Requirements - BipedalWalker-v2 defines "solving" as getting average reward of 300 over 100 consecutive trials


[Training videos](videos/)

[Run in Google Colab](BipedalWalker.ipynb)

Requirements:
- Python
- OpenAI Gym
- Box2D environment

We will be using OpenAI gym, a toolkit for reinforcement learning.
It also gives some standard set of environments. See [env](https://gym.openai.com/envs/)

Setup is really painful and may not even work in local systems. Rather to simplify the reporducibility, use the Google Colab file.
